# API conventions

Rules for the product API under `/api/v1`. Agents depend on it for years, so changes are
additive within a version. The OpenAPI document is served at `/api/v1/openapi.json`.

## Versioning

- Product endpoints live under `/api/v1`. A breaking change means `/api/v2`, not an edit.
- Within a version, only additive changes: new endpoints, new optional request fields,
  new response fields. Clients must ignore fields they do not know.
- `/api/health` is operational and unversioned.
- `/api/auth/*` is [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com)'s own protocol (sign-in,
  sessions, organizations, API keys). It follows Better Auth's conventions, including its
  error shape (`{ "message", "code" }`), not the ones below.

## JSON

- Field names are camelCase (`apiKeyId`, `startAt`), matching the TypeScript and zod
  schemas and Better Auth. Enum values are lowercase snake_case (`api_key`, `round_robin`).
- IDs are UUID strings.
- Timestamps are RFC 3339 strings in UTC with a `Z` suffix, e.g. `2026-10-15T09:30:00.000Z`.
  Calendar dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`; wall-clock times are `HH:MM` with an IANA time zone
  alongside.

## Errors

Every error response has the same shape:

```json
{ "error": "unauthorized", "message": "optional human-readable detail" }
```

`error` is a stable, machine-readable snake_case code that clients may branch on; `message`
is optional and may change. The HTTP status carries the category and the code names the
specific case, e.g. 404 `event_type_not_found`, 409 `slot_taken`. These codes are reserved
for the generic cases in the table below (services cannot use them): `invalid_request`,
`unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found` (unknown endpoint), `method_not_allowed`,
`payload_too_large`, `unsupported_media_type`, `rate_limited`, `internal_error`. Codes are never
renamed within `/api/v1`.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 400 `invalid_request` | The request is malformed (e.g. invalid JSON) or fails schema validation; `message` names the offending fields. Service-level validation uses specific codes |
| 401 `unauthorized` | No valid credentials: missing, unknown, expired or revoked session or API key. Sent with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` |
| 403 `forbidden` | Valid credentials, but the caller may not do this (e.g. not a member of the organization, or a role that lacks the permission) |
| 404 `not_found` | No such resource or endpoint, or one the caller cannot see |
| 409 | Conflict with the current state (e.g. the slot was just booked) |
| 405 `method_not_allowed`, 413 `payload_too_large`, 415 `unsupported_media_type` | Raised by the HTTP layer for the obvious cases; any other 4xx from it is `invalid_request` |
| 429 `rate_limited` | Too many requests; `Retry-After` gives the seconds to wait when known |
| 500 `internal_error` | An unexpected server error; details go to the server log only |

`message` is written for people and is safe to show: it never contains internal error text.

### Where errors come from

Routes call the service layer (`@hourmere/scheduling`), shared with the MCP server so that
people and agents get the same behavior. Services throw `DomainError(kind, code, message?)`
for failures the caller can act on; the server maps the kind to a status and answers
`{ "error": code }` (plus `message` when given):

| `DomainError` kind | Status |
|---|---|
| `invalid` | 400 |
| `forbidden` | 403 |
| `not_found` | 404 |
| `conflict` | 409 |

Anything else a service throws is a bug: 500 `internal_error`, logged on one escaped line.
A lower-level error wrapped as a DomainError's `cause` is logged the same way and never sent
to the client.
New route groups are `RouteModule`s (`apps/server/src/openapi.ts`) created in `index.ts` with
their services and registered by `createApp`; `apps/server/src/app.test.ts` has a template.

## Authentication

A request is authenticated by one of:

- **API key** (agents, scripts): `Authorization: Bearer hm_…`. Keys belong to a user and act
  in one organization, chosen when the key is created (the user's personal organization by
  default). If the Authorization header is present it alone decides: a bad key is a 401
  even when a session cookie is also sent.
- **Session cookie** (the web app, same origin): set by signing in through `/api/auth/*`.
  Requests act in the session's active organization. Cookie-authenticated requests other
  than GET, HEAD and OPTIONS must come from the app's own `Origin` (CSRF protection), or they
  get a 403: Better Auth checks this for `/api/auth/*`, the shared `requireCaller` middleware
  for `/api/v1`. API key requests are exempt.

`GET /api/v1/me` returns the caller, the organization they act in and whether they used a
session or an API key.

## Public endpoints

Booking pages and invitee links work without credentials:

- `/api/v1/public/{handle}/{slug}` (event page, `/slots`, `/bookings`) for personal event types.
- `/api/v1/bookings/manage/{token}` (show, `/cancel`, `/reschedule`): the token is the secret
  from the invitee's link. Only its SHA-256 is stored, so it is returned once, when the
  booking is made, and it is never written to the server log.

They are rate limited per client IP (`TRUSTED_PROXIES` decides which address that is): 120
requests a minute for event pages and for slots, 10 for creating bookings, 30 for manage
links; beyond that 429 `rate_limited` with `Retry-After`. The counters live in each server
process's memory, so with several instances a client gets that budget once per instance; a
shared store comes with multi-instance deployments.

## Retries

`POST /api/v1/public/{handle}/{slug}/bookings` accepts an `Idempotency-Key` header (1–255
printable ASCII characters). A retry with the same key and the same request returns the
original booking with 200 instead of booking again (its `manageToken` is null: the secret is
not stored); the same key with a different request is refused with 409
`idempotency_key_reused`. Keys are scoped to the organization and the caller's API key, and
all anonymous callers share one scope, so they must be random (e.g. a UUIDv4), never derived
from the request.

## Pagination

Lists that can grow without bound, such as `GET /api/v1/bookings`, return a page and a
`nextCursor`; pass it as `cursor` (with the same filters) for the next page. It is null on the
last page. Cursors are opaque. `limit` sets the page size (1–100, default 50).
